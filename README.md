EvanSpec: simple unit tests for C++
===================================

EvanSpec aims to be a really simple unit testing framework for C++.

EvanSpec was written to test code for completeness for a programming class at the University of Michigan. It may not be very complete, and I probably wouldn't recommend it to others. However, I did write it and I figured I should put it up online.

The goals for EvanSpec were as follows:

* One `#include` at the top, all the tests go into the `main()`. All the tests go in one CPP file.
* One simple function that does testing.
* Really easy to learn, really easy to see output.
